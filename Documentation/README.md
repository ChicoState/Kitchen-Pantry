## 3. Libraries Used

## 4. How to Run

### 4.1. Prerequisites
- [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [React-Native](https://reactnative.dev/)
- Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

### 4.2. Install Dependencies
- Run `npm install` in the root directory of the project.

### 4.3. Run the Application
This is one way to run our app â€” you can also run it directly from within Android Studio.

### 4.3.1 Start the Metro Server
- First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.
- To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of our React Native project (/PantryPal): 
```bash
# using npm
npm start
# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

#### 4.3.2 Start the Application
- Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of our React Native project (/PantryPal). Run the following command to start our _Android_ app:
```bash
# using npm
npm run android
# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```
- If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see our new app running in our _Android Emulator_ shortly.
